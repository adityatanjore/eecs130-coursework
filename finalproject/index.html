          My name is Aditya Tanjore, and I study economics, political science,
          and business institutions at Northwestern University. My interests lie
          in the investigation of  interstate conflicts around the globe and understanding the
          economics linked to the emergence of right-wing populist sentiments, as well as in leadership
          development in business and beyond. Please feel free to read through my bio, peruse through my work and thoughts,
          or ask me a question!

        <h2 class = hellotext> Hello! </h2>
        <p class=panepara1>As a native of Chicago, I am more than thrilled to be attending Northwestern University for my undergraduate studies! After growing up in the north suburbs of Chicago for 13 years, I moved to Frankfurt, Germany to complete high school. </p>
        <p class=panepara2> While living in Frankfurt, I developed my interest in the emergence of conflicts, as well as in understanding the development of right-wing populist sentiments. As I began to witness the effects of both of these firsthand in my own community in 2015, when Frankfurt and many other German cities began accepting refugees from Syria and other regions experiencing civil conflict, I became extremely interested in studying these topics in greater detail. </p>
        <p class=panepara3> Since having lived abroad, I have actively begun to explore my interest in the policy implications associated with accepting individuals affected by intrastate conflicts, as well as in leadership development in the business environment through my coursework and extracurricular experiences here at Northwestern. I have especially sought experiences that develop my own personal leadership style in co-founding Lambda Strategy, Northwestern's first strategy consulting group that staffs project teams with both undergraduates and Kellogg MBA candidates, for small- to medium- sized clients operating in the private sector.</p>
        <p class=panepara4> In addition to co-founding Lambda, I have also become very interested in pursuing a career in management consulting, and have become particularly focused on the culture and atmosphere related to recruitment in this industry, especially on Northwestern's campus. </p>
