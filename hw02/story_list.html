            <p>The Snow Image: A Childish Miracle (1851) is a story Hawthorne originally intended for adults, later adapted for children.
              A brother and sister, named Violet and Peony, create a snow girl that magically comes to life, but melts when their unimaginative
              father insists she's real and brings her inside (spoiler alert: she melts). </p>
